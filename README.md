# BlocJams
A front-end music player web application - using JavaScript and jQuery.

## Summary

The goal of this project was to use the front-end web development basics I learned at Bloc and to create my own music player using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
The deployed version can be found [here](https://bloc-jams-player.netlify.com).<br>
I used vanilla JavaScript (and refactored with jQuery) to add animation and effects in the DOM, for example to adjust the song progress and the volume in the player bar.
